Git AI is an open source git extension that tracks the AI-generated code in your repositories. 

Once installed, every AI line is automatically linked to the agent, model, and prompts that generated it — ensuring the intent, requirements, and architecture decisions behind your code are never forgotten:

`git-ai blame blame /src/log_fmt/authorship_log.rs`
```bash

**Our Choices:**
- **No workflow changes** - Just prompt and commit. Git AI accurately tracks AI-code without making your git history messy. 
- **"Detecting" AI-code is an anti-pattern.** — Git AI doesn't guess if a hunk is AI-generated. The Coding Agents that support our standard tell Git AI exactly which lines they generated resulting in the most accurate AI-attribution possible.
- **Git Native** — Git AI created the [open standard](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai/blob/main/specs/git_ai_standard_v3.0.0.md) for tracking AI-generated code with Git Notes. 
- **Local-first** — Works offline, no OpenAI or Anthropic key required.

## AI-Blame 

Git AI blame is a drop-in replacement for `git blame` that reports the AI attribution for each line and is compatible with [all the `git blame` flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).

```bash
git-ai blame /src/log_fmt/authorship_log.rs
```

```bash
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  133) pub fn execute_diff(
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  134)     repo: &Repository,
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  135)     spec: DiffSpec,
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  136)     format: DiffFormat,
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  137) ) -> Result<String, GitAiError> {
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  138)     // Resolve commits to get from/to SHAs
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  139)     let (from_commit, to_commit) = match spec {
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  140)         DiffSpec::TwoCommit(start, end) => {
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  141)             // Resolve both commits
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  142)             let from = resolve_commit(repo, &start)?;
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  143)             let to = resolve_commit(repo, &end)?;
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  144)             (from, to)
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  145)         }
```

### IDE Plugins 

In VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf and Antigravity the [Git AI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=git-ai.git-ai-vscode) shows AI-blame decorations in the gutter that are color-coded by the session that generated those lines. If you have prompt storage setup you can hover over the line to see the raw prompt / summary.

## Understand why with the `/ask` skill

See something you don't understand? The `/ask` skill lets you talk to the agent who wrote the code about its instructions, decisions, and the intent of the engineer who assigned it the task. Git AI gives engineers and agents the context they need to maintain and build on top of AI-generated code.

Git AI installs its `/ask` skill to `~/.agents/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` allowing you to invoke it Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, etc just by typing `/ask`:

```
/ask Why didn't we use the SDK here?
```

Agents with access to the original intent and the source code understand the "why". Agents who can only read the code, can tell you what the code does, but not why: 

| Reading Code + Prompts (`/ask`) | Only Reading Code (not using Git AI) |
|---|---|
| When Aidan was building telemetry, he instructed the agent not to block the exit of our CLI flushing telemetry. Instead of using the Sentry SDK directly, we came up with a pattern that writes events locally first via `append_envelope()`, then flushes them in the background via a detached subprocess. This keeps the hot path fast and ships telemetry async after the fact. | `src/commands/flush_logs.rs` is a 5-line wrapper that delegates to `src/observability/flush.rs` (~700 lines). The `commands/` layer handles CLI dispatch; `observability/` handles Sentry, PostHog, metrics upload, and log processing. Parallel modules like `flush_cas`, `flush_logs`, `flush_metrics_db` follow the same thin-dispatch pattern. |


## Make your agents smarter
Agents make fewer mistakes, and produce more maintainable code, when they understand the requirements and decisions behind the code they're building on. We've found the best way to provide this context is just to provide agents with the same `/ask` tool we built for engineers. Tell your Agents to use `/ask` in Plan mode: 

`Claude|AGENTS.md`
```markdown
- In plan mode, always use the /ask skill so you can read the code and the original prompts that generated it. Intent will help you write a better plan
```

## AI Stats

Measure the % of AI-generated code, accepted-rate by agent and model, and human override rate — for any commit or range of commits.

```bash
git-ai stats --json
```

```json
{
  "human_additions": 28,
  "mixed_additions": 5,
  "ai_additions": 76,
  "ai_accepted": 47,
  "total_ai_additions": 120,
  "total_ai_deletions": 34,
  "time_waiting_for_ai": 240,
  "tool_model_breakdown": {
    "claude_code/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929": {
      "ai_additions": 76,
      "mixed_additions": 5,
      "ai_accepted": 47,
      "total_ai_additions": 120,
      "total_ai_deletions": 34,
      "time_waiting_for_ai": 240
    }
  }
}
```

For team-wide visibility, the [Git AI Stats Bot](https://usegitai.com/enterprise) aggregates data at the PR, repository, and organization level:

- **AI code composition** — track what percentage of code is AI-generated across your org
- **Code durability** — measure how long AI-generated code survives before being modified or removed
- **Agent + model comparison** — see accepted-rate and output quality by agent and model
- **Incident correlation** — understand how AI-authored code correlates with production incidents

### How Does it work?

Supported Coding Agents call Git AI and mark the lines they insert as AI-generated. 

On commit, Git AI saves the final AI-attributions into a Git Note. These notes power AI-Blame, AI contribution stats, and more. The CLI makes sure these notes are preserved through rebases, merges, squashes, cherry-picks, etc.

![Git Tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd20990-ec0b-4a53-afa4-89fa33de9541)

The format of the notes is outlined in the [Git AI Standard v3.0.0](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai/blob/main/specs/git_ai_standard_v3.0.0.md).
