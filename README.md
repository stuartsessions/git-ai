## Quick Start

#### Mac, Linux, Windows (WSL)

```bash
curl -sSL https://usegitai.com/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (non-WSL)

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://usegitai.com/install.ps1 | iex"
```

🎊 That's it! **No per-repo setup.** Once installed Git AI will work OOTB with any of these **Supported Agents**:

### Just Install and Commit

Build as usual. Just prompt, edit and commit. Git AI will track every line of AI-Code and record the Coding Agent, Model, and prompt that generated it.

#### How Does it work? 

Supported Coding Agents call Git AI and mark the lines they insert as AI-generated. 

On commit, Git AI saves the final AI-attributions into a Git Note. These notes power AI-Blame, AI contribution stats, and more. The CLI makes sure these notes are preserved through rebases, merges, squashes, cherry-picks, etc.

The format of the notes is outlined here in the [Git AI Standard v3.0.0](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai/blob/main/specs/git_ai_standard_v3.0.0.md)

## Goals of `git-ai` project

🤖 **Track AI code in a Multi-Agent** world. Because developers get to choose their tools, engineering teams need a **vendor agnostic** way to track AI impact in their repos.

🎯 **Accurate attribution** from Laptop → Pull Request → Merged. Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot cannot track code after generation—Git AI follows it through the entire workflow.

🔄 **Support real-world git workflows** by making sure AI-Authorship annotations survive a `merge --squash`, `rebase`, `reset`, `cherry-pick` etc.

🔗 **Maintain link between prompts and code** - there is valuable context and requirements in team prompts—preserve them alongside code.

🚀 **Git-native + Fast** - `git-ai` is built on git plumbing commands. Negligible impact even in large repos (&lt;100ms). Tested in [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium).

## Agent Support

`git-ai` automatically sets up all supported agent hooks using the `git-ai install-hooks` command
