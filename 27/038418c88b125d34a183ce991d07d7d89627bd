          "text": "Based on the refactoring work we just completed, here's a comprehensive prompt for the next agent:\n\n---\n\n## Test Suite Migration Prompt\n\n**Goal:** Refactor the test suite in `tests/[FILE_NAME].rs` (e.g., `cherry_pick.rs`, `reset.rs`, `rebase.rs`, etc.) to use the new `TestRepo` and `TestFile` fixtures.\n\n### Context\n\nWe've successfully migrated `simple_additions.rs` from the old `TmpRepo` API to a new fluent testing API. Now we need to migrate the remaining test files to use the same patterns.\n\n### New Testing API Overview\n\n**Import structure:**\n```rust\n#[macro_use]\nmod repos;\nuse repos::test_file::ExpectedLineExt;\nuse repos::test_repo::TestRepo;\n```\n\n**Key fixtures:**\n- `TestRepo` - Represents a git repository\n- `TestFile` - Represents a file with expected authorship\n\n**Fluent file API:**\n- `file.set_contents(lines![...])` - Set initial file contents (handles AI/human attribution automatically via checkpoints)\n- `file.insert_at(index, lines![...])` - Insert lines at position\n- `file.replace_at(index, line)` - Replace single line\n- `file.delete_at(index)` - Delete single line\n- `file.delete_range(start, end)` - Delete range [start..end)\n- `file.stage()` - Stage just this file\n- **`file.assert_lines_and_blame(lines![...])`** - Main assertion for fully committed files\n- **`file.assert_committed_lines(lines![...])`** - For partial staging tests (filters uncommitted lines)\n\n**Fluent repo API:**\n- `repo.filename(\"path.txt\")` - Create/get a TestFile\n- `repo.stage_all_and_commit(\"message\")` - Stage all + commit (returns `NewCommit`)\n- `repo.commit(\"message\")` - Commit staged only (returns `NewCommit`)\n- `repo.git(&[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"])` - Run git commands directly for edge cases\n- `repo.git_ai(&[\"arg1\", \"arg2\"])` - Run git-ai commands directly\n\n**Line macro:**\n```rust\nlines![\n    \"Human line\",                    // Defaults to human\n    \"AI line\".ai(),                  // Explicitly AI\n    \"Another human line\".human(),    // Explicitly human\n]\n```\n\n### Migration Guidelines\n\n1. **All tests should be end-to-end** - Use `repo.git()` and `repo.git_ai()` commands, let hooks handle authorship tracking\n2. **Keep all test cases** - Don't remove tests, just adapt them to the new API\n3. **Use fluent assertions** - Every test should end with `assert_lines_and_blame()` or `assert_committed_lines()`\n4. **Reduce snapshot dependency** - Only use snapshots where necessary; prefer explicit assertions with the fluent API\n5. **Partial staging pattern:**\n   ```rust\n   file.insert_at(0, lines![\"staged\".ai()]);\n   file.stage();  // Stage this change\n   \n   file.insert_at(1, lines![\"unstaged\".ai()]);\n   // Don't stage this\n   \n   repo.commit(\"message\").unwrap();\n   \n   // Use assert_committed_lines to ignore unstaged lines\n   file.assert_committed_lines(lines![\"staged\".ai()]);\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove old imports** - Delete unused imports like `TmpRepo`, `LineRange` (unless actually used), `assert_debug_snapshot` (unless keeping snapshots)\n\n### Example Migration\n\n**Before (old TmpRepo API):**\n```rust\nlet tmp_repo = TmpRepo::new().unwrap();\nlet mut file = tmp_repo.write_file(\"test.txt\", \"Line1\\n\", true).unwrap();\ntmp_repo.trigger_checkpoint_with_author(\"test_user\").unwrap();\nfile.append(\"Line 2\\n\").unwrap();\ntmp_repo.trigger_checkpoint_with_ai(\"Claude\", Some(\"claude-3-sonnet\"), Some(\"cursor\")).unwrap();\ntmp_repo.commit_with_message(\"Initial commit\").unwrap();\nlet blame = tmp_repo.blame_for_file(&file, None).unwrap();\nassert_debug_snapshot!(blame);\n```\n\n**After (new fluent API):**\n```rust\nlet repo = TestRepo::new();\nlet mut file = repo.filename(\"test.txt\");\n\nfile.set_contents(lines![\n    \"Line1\",\n    \"Line 2\".ai(),\n]);\n\nrepo.stage_all_and_commit(\"Initial commit\").unwrap();\n\nfile.assert_lines_and_blame(lines![\n    \"Line1\".human(),\n    \"Line 2\".ai(),\n]);\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] All tests compile and pass\n- [ ] No remaining `TmpRepo` references\n- [ ] Every test ends with an assertion (usually `assert_lines_and_blame` or `assert_committed_lines`)\n- [ ] Code is more readable - the test intent should be clear from the fluent API\n- [ ] Partial staging tests use `file.stage()` + `assert_committed_lines()`\n- [ ] No unused imports warnings\n\n### Tips\n\n- **Start simple**: Migrate basic tests first to get familiar with the API\n- **For complex operations** (cherry-pick, rebase, reset): Use `repo.git(&[\"command\", \"args\"])` for the git operations, then assert with the fluent API\n- **When stuck**: Look at `tests/simple_additions.rs` for patterns\n- **Ask for help**: If you need new helper methods in `TestFile` or `TestRepo`, ask!\n\n---\n\nThis prompt should give the next agent everything they need to successfully migrate another test file! 🚀",
