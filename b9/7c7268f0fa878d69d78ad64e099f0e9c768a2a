Let me create a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nSuccessfully implemented the **BatchGit singleton system** with the following changes:\n\n### 1. Created `src/git/batch.rs`\n- Implemented `CatFileBatch` as a global singleton using `OnceLock<Mutex<...>>`\n- Maintains a long-lived `git cat-file --batch` process to eliminate IPC startup costs\n- Key features:\n  - Lazy initialization on first use\n  - Handles multiple git repositories by restarting the process when `git_dir` changes (important for tests)\n  - Implements both `object_type()` and `blob_content()` methods\n  - Protocol follows git's native batch format: `<oid>\\n` → `<oid> <type> <size>\\n<content>\\n`\n\n### 2. Modified `src/git/repository.rs`\n- **Removed** the `batch_enabled` field entirely (as requested)\n- **Removed** the `disable_batch()` method\n- Simplified `object_type()` to always use `CatFileBatch`\n- Simplified `Blob::content()` to always use `CatFileBatch`\n- Batching is now **always enabled** with no fallback option\n\n### 3. Updated `src/git/mod.rs`\n- Added `pub mod batch;` declaration\n\n### 4. Tests\n- All 4 batch-specific tests pass\n- All 78 library tests pass\n- Batch system correctly handles multiple repositories in test scenarios\n\nThe implementation provides significant performance improvements for operations that perform many Git object lookups (like checkpoint operations and blame), by eliminating the ~5-10ms process startup overhead for each `cat-file` call.",

Other commands like `rev-parse`, `show`, `ls-tree`, etc. don't have batch modes.\n\nHowever, I can optimize a few things:\n\n1. Some simple `rev-parse` operations (like ref→OID resolution) could potentially use `cat-file --batch-check` instead\n2. We could add a cache layer, but that adds complexity and state management\n\n**Here's what's already optimized:**\n- `object_type()` - Uses `CatFileBatch` ✅  \n- `Blob::content()` - Uses `CatFileBatch` ✅\n\n**What remains unoptimized (by necessity):**\n- All `rev-parse` calls (no git batch support)\n- All `show` calls (no git batch support)  \n- All `ls-tree` calls (no git batch support)\n- All `merge-tree`, `merge-base`, `diff`, etc. (no git batch support)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Add caching** for frequently-called operations like `rev-parse`?\n2. **Use `cat-file --batch-check`** for simple ref resolution instead of `rev-parse`?\n3. **Leave it as-is** since we've already optimized what git supports batching?\n\nLet me know which approach you prefer!",
